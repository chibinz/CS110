/* Writes instructions during the assembler's first pass to OUTPUT. The case
   for general instructions has already been completed, but you need to write
   code to translate the li, bge and mv pseudoinstructions. Your pseudoinstruction
   expansions should not have any side effects.

   NAME is the name of the instruction, ARGS is an array of the arguments, and
   NUM_ARGS specifies the number of items in ARGS.

   Error checking for regular instructions are done in pass two. However, for
   pseudoinstructions, you must make sure that ARGS contains the correct number
   of arguments. You do NOT need to check whether the registers / label are
   valid, since that will be checked in part two.

   Also for li:
    - make sure that the number is representable by 32 bits. (Hint: the number
        can be both signed or unsigned).
    - if the immediate can fit in the imm field of an addiu instruction, then
        expand li into a single addi instruction. Otherwise, expand it into
        a lui-addi pair.

   And for bge and move:
    - your expansion should use the fewest number of instructions possible.

   venus has slightly different translation rules for li, and it allows numbers
   larger than the largest 32 bit number to be loaded with li. You should follow
   the above rules if venus behaves differently.

   Use fprintf() to write. If writing multiple instructions, make sure that
   each instruction is on a different line.

   Returns the number of instructions written (so 0 if there were any errors).

   You must perform error checking on all instructions and make sure that their
   arguments are valid. If an instruction is invalid, you should not write
   anything to OUTPUT but simply return -1. venus may be a useful resource for
   this step.

   definition comes afterwards, you must declare it first (see translate.h).
